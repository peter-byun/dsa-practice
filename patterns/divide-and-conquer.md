Here's how it works in general.

1. Divide large data into smaller chunks.
2. Perform the same process for each chunk
   By dividing the large data, and processing each chunk, you can leverage what's revealed by processing the chunks.
   For example, in Merge Sort, you can sort each chunk and then merge the sorted chunks.
3. (If needed)Combine the results of each chunk to get the final result.
