Here I've organized some problem solving patterns introduced by Colt Steele in one of his famous courses.
Some patterns, such as Frequency Counter Pattern and Multiple Pointer, were originally named by him, so I kept the name as is, but I tried to use examples different than the ones introduced in the course.
